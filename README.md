# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the **ML Projects** repository! This repo showcases a collection of my machine learning projects ranging from foundational implementations to applied ML use cases. All projects are built with a focus on learning, experimentation, and clarity.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. 🔧 Neural Network Foundations
> A neural network built entirely from scratch using NumPy, with forward and backward propagation, training loops, and performance evaluation.

- No deep learning libraries used
- Focus on understanding the math behind backprop
- Modular implementation

📁 Folder: `neural-net-foundations/`

---

### 2. 🚲 Bike Usage Prediction
> Predicting daily bike rental counts based on weather and seasonal features using regression models.

- Feature engineering and EDA
- Linear Regression, Random Forests
- RMSE and R² evaluation

📁 Folder: `bike-usage-prediction/`

---

### 3. 🧠 MNIST Classifier (Alternate)
> A clean, modular digit classifier using PyTorch (alternate to the basic MNIST tutorials).

- Custom training loop
- CNN-based architecture
- Live accuracy & loss plots

📁 Folder: `mnist-classifier-alternate/`

---

### 4. 🧪 SVM in MATLAB
> Implementation of Support Vector Machine from scratch in MATLAB for binary classification tasks.

- Mathematical grounding in optimization
- Linear kernel implementation
- Decision boundary visualization

📁 Folder: `svm-matlab/`

---

### 5. 🧊 Kaggle: Titanic Survival Prediction
> A classic ML problem tackled using logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble models.

- Feature cleaning and preprocessing
- Cross-validation and tuning
- Submission-ready notebook

📁 Folder: `kaggle-titanic/`
