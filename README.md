# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects exploring various algorithms, from foundational implementations to applied classification problems. The emphasis is on building a strong conceptual understanding through hands-on experimentation.

## Projects Included

### 1. Neural Network Foundations  
An end-to-end neural network built using only NumPy. The project covers manual implementation of forward and backward propagation along with basic training logic. It serves as a learning tool to reinforce the mathematical foundations of neural networks.

### 2. Bike Usage Prediction  
A classification-based approach to identify hours of high bike demand using temporal and weather data. The project includes exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and comparison of multiple classification models ranging from logistic regression to ensemble methods like bagging and boosting.

### 3. MNIST Classifier (Alternate)  
A minimalist approach to handwritten digit classification using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The project compresses input images and classifies them based on characteristic matrices derived from training data.

üìÅ Folder: `mnist-classifier-alternate/`

### 4. Support Vector Machine in MATLAB  
An optimization-based implementation of Support Vector Machine from scratch using MATLAB. The SVM is formulated as a quadratic programming problem with slack variables and solved using `quadprog`. Evaluations are performed on a real-world medical dataset.

üìÅ Folder: `svm-matlab/`

### 5. Kaggle: Titanic Survival Prediction  
A submission to the Titanic competition on Kaggle. The project involves feature engineering, model comparison, and hyperparameter tuning across baseline classifiers including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

üìÅ Folder: `kaggle-titanic/`
